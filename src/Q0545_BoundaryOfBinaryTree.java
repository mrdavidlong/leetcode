Given a binary tree, return the values of its boundary in anti-clockwise direction starting from root. Boundary includes left boundary, leaves, and right boundary in order without duplicate nodes.

Left boundary is defined as the path from root to the left-most node. Right boundary is defined as the path from root to the right-most node. If the root doesn't have left subtree or right subtree, then the root itself is left boundary or right boundary. Note this definition only applies to the input binary tree, and not applies to any subtrees.

The left-most node is defined as a leaf node you could reach when you always firstly travel to the left subtree if exists. If not, travel to the right subtree. Repeat until you reach a leaf node.

The right-most node is also defined by the same way with left and right exchanged.

Example 1

Input:
  1
   \
    2
   / \
  3   4

Ouput:
[1, 3, 4, 2]

Explanation:
The root doesn't have left subtree, so the root itself is left boundary.
The leaves are node 3 and 4.
The right boundary are node 1,2,4. Note the anti-clockwise direction means you should output reversed right boundary.
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicates and we have [1,3,4,2].
Example 2

Input:
    ____1_____
   /          \
  2            3
 / \          /
4   5        6
   / \      / \
  7   8    9  10

Ouput:
[1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3]

Explanation:
The left boundary are node 1,2,4. (4 is the left-most node according to definition)
The leaves are node 4,7,8,9,10.
The right boundary are node 1,3,6,10. (10 is the right-most node).
So order them in anti-clockwise without duplicate nodes we have [1,2,4,7,8,9,10,6,3].

    Approach #2 Using PreOrder Traversal [Accepted]

Algorithm

Before we dive into this approach, let's look at the preorder traversal of a simple Binary Tree as shown below:

Preorder Traversal

From the above figure, we can observe that our problem statement is very similar to the Preorder traversal. Actually, the order of traversal is the same(except for the right boundary nodes, for which it is the reverse), but we need to selectively include the nodes in the return result list. Thus, we need to include only those nodes in the result, which are either on the left boundary, the leaves or the right boundary.

In order to distinguish between the various kinds of nodes, we make use of a
f
l
a
g
flag as follows:

Flag=0: Root Node.

Flag=1: Left Boundary Node.

Flag=2: Right Boundary Node.

Flag=3: Others(Middle Node).

We make use of three lists \text{left_boundary}, \text{right_boundary},
leaves
leaves to store the appropriate nodes and append the three lists at the end.

We go for the normal preorder traversal, but while calling the recursive function for preorder traversal using the left child or the right child of the current node, we also pass the
f
l
a
g
flag information indicating the type of node that the current child behaves like.

For obtaining the flag information about the left child of the current node, we make use of the function leftChildFlag(node, flag). In the case of a left child, the following cases are possible, as can be verified by looking at the figure above:

The current node is a left boundary node: In this case, the left child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between E & J in the above figure.

The current node is a root node: In this case, the left child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between A & B in the above figure.

The current node is a right boundary node: In this case, if the right child of the current node doesn't exist, the left child always acts as the right boundary node. e.g. G & N. But, if the right child exists, the left child always acts as the middle node. e.g. C & F.

Similarly, for obtaining the flag information about the right child of the current node, we make use of the function rightChildFlag(node, flag). In the case of a right child, the following cases are possible, as can be verified by looking at the figure above:

The current node is a right boundary node: In this case, the right child will always be a right boundary node. e.g. relationship between C & G in the above figure.

The current node is a root node: In this case, the right child will always be a left boundary node. e.g. relationship between A & C in the above figure.

The current node is a left boundary node: In this case, if the left child of the current node doesn't exist, the right child always acts as the left boundary node. e.g. B & E. But, if the left child exists, the left child always acts as the middle node.

Making use of the above information, we set the
f
l
a
g
flag appropriately, which is used to determine the list in which the current node has to be appended.
