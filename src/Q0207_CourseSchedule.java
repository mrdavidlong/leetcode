 *
 * There are a total of n courses you have to take, labeled from 0 to n-1.

 Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: [0,1]

 Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, is it possible for you to finish all courses?

 Example 1:

 Input: 2, [[1,0]]
 Output: true
 Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
 Example 2:

 Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
 Output: false
 Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take.
 To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
 also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.
 Note:

 The input prerequisites is a graph represented by a list of edges, not adjacency matrices. Read more about how a graph is represented.
 You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.
