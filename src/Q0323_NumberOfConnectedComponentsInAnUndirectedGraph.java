Given n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1 and a list of undirected edges (each edge is a pair of nodes), write a function to find the number of connected components in an undirected graph.

Example 1:

Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [3, 4]]

     0          3
     |          |
     1 --- 2    4

Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: n = 5 and edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]

     0           4
     |           |
     1 --- 2 --- 3

Output:  1
Note:
You can assume that no duplicate edges will appear in edges. Since all edges are undirected, [0, 1] is the same as [1, 0] and thus will not appear together in edges.

    This is 1D version of Number of Islands II. For more explanations, check out this 2D Solution.

n points = n islands = n trees = n roots.
With each edge added, check which island is e[0] or e[1] belonging to.
If e[0] and e[1] are in same islands, do nothing.
Otherwise, union two islands, and reduce islands count by 1.
Bonus: path compression can reduce time by 50%.
Hope it helps!
