/*
Given strings S and T, find the minimum (contiguous) substring W of S, so that T is a subsequence of W.

If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string "". If there are multiple such minimum-length windows, return the one with the left-most starting index.

Example 1:

Input:
S = "abcdebdde", T = "bde"
Output: "bcde"
Explanation:
"bcde" is the answer because it occurs before "bdde" which has the same length.
"deb" is not a smaller window because the elements of T in the window must occur in order.


Note:

All the strings in the input will only contain lowercase letters.
The length of S will be in the range [1, 20000].
The length of T will be in the range [1, 100].

dp[i][j] stores the starting index of the substring where T has length i and S has length j.

So dp[i][j would be:
if T[i - 1] == S[j - 1], this means we could borrow the start index from dp[i - 1][j - 1] to make the current substring valid;
else, we only need to borrow the start index from dp[i][j - 1] which could either exist or not.

Finally, go through the last row to find the substring with min length and appears first.
